While I make every effort to deliver quality plugins for Wolf CMS, I do not guarantee that they are free from defects. They are provided â€œas is," and you use it at your own risk. I'll be happy if you notice me of any errors.

I'm not really programmer nor web developer, however I like programming PHP and JavaScript. In fact I'm an [architekt](http://marekmurawski.pl).
